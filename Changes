    Makefile, debian/control
        Require DBD::SQLite version 1.14 as it seems earlier versions have a
        problem resulting in errors along the lines of "underlying database
        changed".
    
    SQL::DB
        Unset dbh->{PrintError} and set dbh->{RaiseError} on connect().
    
        All sequences are now created in a separate transaction to the table
        creation, as PostreSQL doesn't think the tables exist until the
        transaction is committed.
    
        Fixed some style issues located with 'perlcritic'.
    
        New private method _undeploy() (does a DROP TABLE ...) for use with the
        tests.
    
    t/*
        New library t/lib/SQLDBTest.pm to allow all tests to be run the same

        deploy() now run as a transaction.
    
        _nopc (no prepare_cached) methods created for do(), fetch() and
        fetch1(). The original methods now all use prepare_cached by default.
    
        Call $sth->finish on do() and fetch1() methods. Should get rid of the
        "Statement handle still Active" messages which caused v0.11 to fail
        for every CPAN tester. I can't reproduce the problem locally so this is
        a bit of a guess.
    
    SQL::DB::Cursor
        New internal method "_finish()" to allow SQL::DB->fetch1() to finish
        off the statement handle after the first row is retrieved.

    SQL::DB::Row
        new_from_array() and new() now properly set the original and modified
        flags on column values.
    
        New method: _column_names() returns a list.
    
    SQL::DB::Schema
        New EXISTS() function, maps straight to the SQL EXISTS.  Is uppercase
        to avoid conflicting with the Perl 'exists'.
    
    SQL::DB::Schema::AColumn

    SQL::DB::Schema::ARow

        not 't'. Makes the statements much clearer when debugging. The id is
        now tied to the object and is reused after the object is destroyed.
        So now statements will generally always have the same query text
        (provided the query is the same) which is important when wanting to
        make use of DBI's prepare_cached() method.
    
    SQL::DB::Schema::Expr

    SQL::DB::Row
        Bugfix: _hashref() was working it's way through the known columns list,
        not the method list, generating a hash with missing keys or overwritten
        values.
    
        Bugfix: q_update() was previously unaware of the relationship between
        columns and ARows. So if you fetched a self join then q_update would
        not produce the correct updates.

    * Preliminary support Multi-faceted Table/Column Definitions.
    
    The idea behind this is that certain definitions have a 'normal' and a
    'database' specific setting, and the right one gets automatically used at
    runtime.
    
    For example, say we have a binary column which under SQLite and MySQL the
    'BLOB' type works fine, but under PostgreSQL we have to use 'BYTEA'.
    Our column definition can now be like this:
    
      [ name => 'bincol', type => 'BLOB', type_pg => 'BYTEA' ]
    
    Internally SQL::DB at connect() time tells the tables what kind of
    database we have (based on the dbi: connection string) and the table
    objects know which definition to use. 'type_pg' for postgres and 'type' for
    everything else.
    
    So far only implemented for things like the default character set and the
    mysql ENGINE statement.
    
    SQL::DB
        Next sequence is now seq($name, $count) and the optional $count will
        increment by that amount and return a list of ($count) unique ids.
    
        Now set table database type at connect() time.
    
    SQL::DB::Row
        Detect and croak() if caller attempt to create a class with duplicate
        column names.
    
    SQL::DB::Schema::Table
        Multifaced definition support for 'type', 'engine', 'default_charset'
        and 'tablespace'.

    SQL::DB::Schema
        Schema objects are no longer responsible for define()ing tables.
        $obj->define() has been replaced by the class subroutine
        define_tables(). This fixes the issue of persisent (or other)
        environments unecessarily redefining the schema each time an object
        is created.
    
        The new() method now takes an (optional) list of table names and takes
        the definition from the class as needed.
    
    SQL::DB
        deploy() now calculates the table order based on sql REFERENCES
        values so that referenced tables exists before the referring
        column/table is created..

Author: Mark Lawrence <nomad@null.net>
Date:   Mon Oct 8 23:51:08 2007 +0200

    Added support for DBI bind types. Each column can now have a 'bind_type'
    definition which will be used for INSERT and UPDATE queries. The reason
    it got implemented this way at the moment is because I needed an SQL_BLOB
    column with SQLite and they were the only query types that caused me issues.
    Should it be standard for all query types?

    SQL::DB
        In query_as_string() only quote values that are printable, otherwise
        insert the string *BINARY DATA* into the output.
    
    SQL::DB::Row
        Bugfix: sub new() now correctly set column status as ORIGINAL or
        MODIFIED based on the initial values. No longer calls
        new_from_arrayref().
    
        Moved _inflate() and _deflate() into the classes themselves. Row is now
        'invisible' (ie no in the inheritance tree) although that is not the
        goal.
    
        Bugfix: sub q_insert() now correctly handles multiple-column primary
        keys.

    SQL::DB::Row
        Moved new_from_arrayref() directly into the classes instead of being
        inherited in order to ensure the STATUS condition exists for every
        column of a new object.
    
        SQL::DB::Schema::Column "default" values (or methods) are now set at
        object instantiation.
    
    SQL::DB::Table
        Use SQL::DB::Row instead of SQL::DB::Object for base of table classes.
    
    SQL::DB::Object.

    SQL::DB::Row
        Bugfix: Now correctly check for inflate condition when defining
        _deflate() method;
    
        new() method renamed to new_from_arrayref().
    
        Each class now gets a new() method that takes either a hashref or a list
        of key/value pairs and in turn calls new_from_arrayref().
    
        Each class now gets a q_insert() method (similar to q_update()).

    SQL::DB
        Improved the debugging output to show a real SQL statement with the

    General
        New: Inflation of columns upon SELECT. Deflation in the works.
        All _new() methods have become new() to be more standard.
    
    SQL::DB
        Clearer error messages on some failure/error conditions.
        Fixed position of FOR UPDATE in the internal sequence support.
        fetch()/fetch1() adjusted to the new SQL::DB::Row implementation.
        Documentation cleanup.
    
    SQL::DB::Row
        Complete rewrite to be a more intelligent object. Now keeps track of:
        a) the SQL::DB::Columns associated with the query / class; and b) the
        columns that have been modified. So now we can call q_update() and
        get a list of statements for each table to update the modified columns.
    
    SQL::DB::Expr
        New utility methods val() and set_val() for use by parent classes
        (abstracts away the internals which AColumn had been using).
        New between() (SQL BETWEEN) method. Just realised should be in AColumn.
    
    SQL::DB::Function
        New SQL functions: CAST, NOW
        Big cleanup / refactoring.
    
    SQL::DB::Query
        Removed the unused column_names() method.
    
    SQL::DB::Schema, SQL::DB::Table
        Moved the guts of the arow() method from Schema to Table where it
        belongs. Thinking about renaming it atable() as that is what it looks
        like it is when writing queries.
    
    SQL::DB::AColumn
        as_string(), _clone() and _as() all moved/removed into the parent
        SQL::DB::Expr class as they are more general methods than just AColumn.
    
    SQL::DB::Column
        New "inflate" and "deflate" definitions to for modifying column data
        between the database and the SQL::DB::Row objects.
        "default" definition now accepts a subref as well scalars.
    
    SQL::DB::Object
        Runs the "default" method for a column if it is a CODE ref, when
        creating objects.

    SQL::DB::Query
        Removed 'selecto' option (not very SQL'ish).

    Syntax changes:
        Abstract rows are now associated with table names only and must be
        obtained via $db->arow($tablename). The old "Artist->arow" or
        "Artist::Abstract->new" are gone.
    SQL::DB::Table
        Abstract classes are now named SQL::DB::ARow::<tablename>
    SQL::DB::Row
        New module providing lightweight ARRAY-based objects. This
        functionality has been removed from SQL::DB. I should be able to
        replace this with something from CPAN but couldn't find the right thing
        yet.
    SQL::DB
        fetch() and fetch1() now use the most efficient DBI calls to obtain
        data.
        New methods fetcho() and fetcho1() for retrieving full objects. These
        should eventually moved out of SQL::DB entirely? SQL::DBO?
        Documentation cleanup.
    SQL::DB::Function
        Added PostgreSQL nextval(), currval() and setval() functions.
    SQL::DB::Object
        Removed arow() method. SQL::DB::Object should be completely decoupled
        from anything else.
    SQL::DB::Schema
        New arow() method.

        Various additions and cleanups.

    Added temporary set() function to SQL::DB::AColumn so that one can
    write "set => [$arow->acolumn->set($val)]" statements. Considering using
    the modifiable subroutine lvalue (Experimental) support in perl so that
    we can write "set => [$arow->acolumn = $val]" instead, which is much
    more SQL-like.
